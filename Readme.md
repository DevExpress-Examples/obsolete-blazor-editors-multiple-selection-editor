
# Blazor Editors - How to implement the multiple selection editor

â›” DEPRECATED. This example was deprecated. 

In v19.2.3 and higher, we implemented the [TagBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2) editor that allows users to select multiple items (tags) from a predefined drop-down list. Please check the [TagBox demo](https://demos.devexpress.com/Blazor/TagBox) for details.

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
